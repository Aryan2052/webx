## The Gradio Web App *(Browseruse enabled)*

1. Initially install all the required libs and their dependencies:

   ```pwsh
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Install **Playwright** (after installing the requirements):

   ```pwsh
   playwright install
   ```

3. Next, run `app.py` using:

   ```pwsh
   python app.py
   ```
